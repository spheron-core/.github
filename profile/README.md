# 🌐 Spheron Foundation

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the **Spheron Foundation** — an open infrastructure protocol for a compute and GPU-native world.

---

## 🚀 Mission

Spheron Network is building the world’s largest **community-powered data center** by turning idle gaming rigs, home desktops, and everyday machines into income-generating compute nodes.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, ML, and digital workloads, Spheron empowers everyday users to contribute compute and earn—transforming underutilized devices into globally accessible infrastructure.

---

## 🌍 Vision

Spheron envisions a world where access to high-performance compute is democratized—no longer locked behind cloud monopolies or capital-intensive setups.

By unlocking underutilized consumer GPUs and devices, Spheron enables:
- Anyone to become a node operator and monetize their hardware
- Developers to deploy AI workloads, inference tasks, and decentralized storage effortlessly
- A protocol-native compute marketplace governed by its contributors, not corporations

With a permissionless stack built on [Base](https://base.org), Spheron is already powering **43,000+ nodes** and **7,000+ GPUs** across **170+ regions**.

Spheron is not a product — it’s a permissionless protocol, powered by people.  
Your machine is no longer idle.  
It’s part of a global, decentralized supercomputer.
